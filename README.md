# Security Manager Kata

The goal here is to refactor this codebase

# What are the issues ?

- Tests

There are no tests, maybe we could do something about this

Note that as there are no tests, you can't be sure you introduce a regression, so how could you make sure you don't introduce a regression ?

- Dependencies

The method have two implicit dependencies, this could be useful to get rid of them

- Security

The password security is not really strong enough, could you make it more secure ?

- TypeScript

This codebase is not really idiomatic TypeScript, do you think you could make it more idiomatic ?

This means that usually, a codebase written in TypeScript shouldn't look like this
